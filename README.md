A simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with **PyTorch** that learns to generate 28×28 grayscale images of clothing items (t‑shirts, shoes, bags, etc.) from the [Fashion‑MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Trains a basic GAN using linear layers  
✅ Automatically downloads and loads the Fashion‑MNIST dataset  
✅ Visualizes **real vs fake images** after each epoch  
✅ Tracks and plots **generator & discriminator losses**  
✅ Includes code to **generate new images** after training

---

## 📦 Requirements
Install these dependencies before running:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

---

## How to Run
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debasishbiswal/fashion-mnist-gan.git
cd fashion-mnist-gan
```

Open the notebook (Fashion Test GAN.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

➡️ Important:
If using Google Colab, enable GPU:
Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU

Run all cells in order.
Training will start and after each epoch you’ll see:

- Real vs generated images side by side
- Printed Generator and Discriminator losses

## Example Outputs
Example training output after several epochs:

Epoch [1/200] Loss D: 0.0040, Loss G: 7.6087

Epoch [6/200] Loss D: 0.0586, Loss G: 4.1694

Epoch [200/200] Loss D: 0.5574, Loss G: 1.4600
<img width="1588" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc0faad-d2f7-46f0-906a-262df62d6e78" />

✅ Fake images gradually start to resemble Fashion-MNIST clothing items.
